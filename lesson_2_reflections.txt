What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates the .git directory to store meta data about changes
to any files you decide to track.  You need to do it so git knows you want to create a repository
in this location to begin tracking changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
As you begin to edit files you can add them to the staging area so once you are ready to commit
you don't need to remember which files you changed that need to be part of this commit as
you added them to the staging area as you found a need to edit them.  This workflow will
minimize the human error potential.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

add them to the staging area one at a time and commit them seperatly.
